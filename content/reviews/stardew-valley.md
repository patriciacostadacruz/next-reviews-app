**Stardew Valley** is a beautiful, fun game that, when all of its parts are pulled together, make for a wonderful countryside adventure. Whether itâ€™s rainy, sunny, snowy, or dusted with pollen drifts through the air, each day offers an abundance of great activities ready to be collected or mastered and new friendships waiting to be made.

Even 100 hours in with three in-game years in the books, I still feel like I have so many mysteries to discover, and plenty of items to collect. New items, goals, and events from all the updates since its launch make Stardew Valley more welcoming for new players and extends its life for seasoned farmers, too.

The fantastic multiplayer is just the cherry on top of the cake to this marvelous farming RPG.
